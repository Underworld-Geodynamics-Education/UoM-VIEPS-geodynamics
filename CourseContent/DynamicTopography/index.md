# Dynamic Topography

_Dynamic Topography_ has a very specific meaning in geodynamics. It is the topography which results from viscous flow processes in the mantle. It is often easier to think about what it is not: isostatically compensated topography is topography which is sustained by a buoyancy equilibrium, elastically supported topography is in equilibrium with elastic stresses in the lithosphere. Neither of these two sources of topography is associated with any motion.

Generally, all of these forms of topography contribute to the observed surface height for the Earth.

Our goal in this section of the course is to develop a good intuition for dynamic topography. We are going to run three cases:

   1. A model in which we watch a floating blob approach isostatic equilibrium.

   2. A model with a sinking blob where we attempt to measure the topography.

   3. Instantaneous flow models where we look at the surface stresses and try to relate the topography to the viscosity structure.
