    "## Non-linear feedbacks in the material strength\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed what happens when the strength of a material under loading decreases as a function of the loading. Materials with this property often form highly localised regions of rapid deformation surrounded by stagnant regions where there is a very much lower rate of deformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, the 'failure' of one part of the system will unload / de-stress the remainder of the system and the  response to loading occurs as if the entire material had the lower strength of the failed regions. This is what leads to the flat parts of the stress v. strain or stress v. strain-rate curves from the lecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you have been provided with two notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - ShearBandsSimpleShear \n",
    "   - ShearBandsPureShear\n",
    "   \n",
    "The first of these is a wrapped-around-box which is sheared by top and bottom velocities. The box is full of a material with strength that is limited by friction:\n",

    "The second notebook is a _pure shear_ example in which the box is stretched at the sides and extends the sample. The material forms \"shear bands\" which are a little bit like normal faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to see if / the extent to which the shear bands which form during deformation are a reasonable approximation to crustal faults. First you can look at the **simple shear** case and ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Are they narrow, highly elongated structures ?\n",
    "   - Do they concentrate the deformation in the system ?\n",
    "   - Do they form at the appropriate angle to the prevailing stress field ?\n",
    "   \n",
    "Unfortunately, you will not get to run many experiments because they take a long while to run a high resolution and at low resolution they don't form properly. You will need to investigate the necessary resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are happy with the model you need, try comparing the results of your own models with the examples taken from the **pure shear** notebook which I have run and are shown below (images only). I tried to vary the friction coefficient (0.3 and 0.6) and the viscosity of the layer that the \"crust\" is floating on (0.01, 1.0 and 10).\n",
