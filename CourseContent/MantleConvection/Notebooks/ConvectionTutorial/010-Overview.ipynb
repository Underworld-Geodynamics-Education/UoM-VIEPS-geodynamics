    "## What have we not covered ?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many aspects of the `underworld` code and of modelling in general that we have not dealt with here, or have only touched upon in a general way. Some of these issues apply to all the different numerical methods and tools you might come across.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Where can I find out more ?**  _Python codes include 'docstrings' which can be quite helpful and you should always take a look. help() grabs the docstrings for you._\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Treat the code like a black box, how do you know when to trust the output ?** _In `underworld`, we treat this question very seriously and we bundle a whole collection of analytic Stokes flow problems in with the code ( `help(uw.fn.analytic)` )_\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **What are the trade-offs between resolution, accuracy, choice of solvers, speed, parallel performance etc etc ?** _You probably want to find the answer(s) to that question out for yourself, I just want to make you aware that it is one of the key questions in modeling. Having analytic or approximate solutions to hand is very helpful in this case. Also seeing if the results **converge** to a specific answer as you put more resources into the solution._ \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Particles and material history.** _One of the reasons `underworld` was written was to look at problems of complex fluids - ones where the material history is relevant to the constitutive behaviour (e.g. anisotropy, viscoelasticity, strain-softening ...). There are examples of these in the `underworld` user guide and tutorials._\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Parallel ?** _Most of the time, the python scripts will run fine in parallel, some of the more convoluted things we saw in the examples are the result of guiding you to parallel safe methods (e.g. the `uw.fn.view.maxmin` which works in parallel when numpy.max() does not). Also, the whole `gLucifer` visualisation framework is designed for use in parallel. Have a look at the examples, they all work in parallel._\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Saving data.** _You can save and read back all field and swarm variables and this all works in parallel. The file formats are hdf5 and these can be read later (in serial if you can't process your results easily in parallel). This is important as you may / will want to checkpoint and restart jobs that take a long time to run. **Warning:** you will have to make sure your scripts handle whatever branches arise from restarting as we cannot snapshot your scripts and save them._\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Workflow.** _There are many, many python packages available which will just work with underworld. For example, to allow you to set up complicated pattens of particles using projections, mapping data to material properties or comparing observations and model outputs. Many are already built-in to `scipy`. You might end up with some issues in parallel if you are not careful (e.g. `scipy`'s fft routines), but perhaps you can create a workflow in which this processing is handled in serial, saves hdf5 information, and is then used to initialise a parallel script._\n",
