# VIEPS Geodynamics 2018


This course provides an introduction to geodynamics with hands-on tutorials using the
[underworld](http://www.underworldcode.org) software package.

## Instructors

  * Louis Moresi
  * Rebecca Farrington (guest lecture)

## Course Content

The course runs for five days and combines lecture material with computational practical work. The course content is as follows:


   Day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     | Time     | Content
  -------- | -------  | -------
**1** | am    | Introduction to global geodynamics / planetary dynamics and the concepts of plate tectonics, mantle convection and the global heat engine. The physics of mantle flow in terrestrial planets.
**1** | pm  | Introduction to numerical models, the Stokes equation for viscous flow driven by boundary conditions and buoyancy. The sinking blob and Rayleigh Taylor instability as modelled by underworld.
**2** | am    | Heat transport, convection, rheology and the internal dynamics of solid planets. The physical manifestation of convective heat transfer and the existence of boundary layers. How Rayleigh number and velocity / heat flow are related.
**2** | pm  | Numerical solutions of convection using Underworld. Exploring the influence of Rayleigh number on the convecting system. Demonstrating that Ra is the only free parameter, understanding the numerical requirements for solution (including the trade offs between resolution, accuracy and speed)
**3** | am    | Internal dynamics and the figure of the Earth. Dynamic topography and gravity and the relationship between surface deflection, buoyancy and viscosity layering.
**3** | pm  | Computing dynamic topography for a sinking / rising blob, determining the influence of viscosity and depth on measurements at the surface. Is there symmetry between a hot and a cold blob ?
**4** | am   | Rheology, non-Newtonian viscosity, localisation and the deformation of the lithosphere. How plate tectonics relates to mantle convection.
**4** | pm  | Exploring some simple experiments which form shear bands. Plotting strength profiles for deforming lithosphere.
**5** | am    | Heat flow, the age of the Earth, boundary layers, half-space cooling and the oceanic lithosphere.
**5** | pm  | Some simple models which look like subduction and help us to understand the dynamics of subducting slabs.


## Notes

There is a set of background notes for mantle dynamics and computation bundled with the course. You don't _have_ to read and understand all this material, it is simply provided for your information and to give backup proofs of some of the concepts which we will be stating throughout the course. The notes are in two parts: [Geodynamics theory](./ComputationalGeodynamics/TheoreticalBackground/index.md) and an [Introduction to Numerical Methods](./ComputationalGeodynamics/NumericalMethodsPrimer/index.md).
