# Subduction zones

This part of the course will start with a (re-)introduction to how thermal boundary layers grow and how this relates to estimates for the age of the Earth. We have thought about boundary layers being part of the convection cell, but it is a little bit more complicated when the lithosphere has a very complicated rheology and forms localised plate boundaries.

In fact, it is often easier to think about the cool thermal boundary layer (the plate) as being separated from the convecting fluid that produces it. There is a long tradition of modeling subduction zones this way - worrying about the balance of plate forces - and we will explore this numerically as well as in simple thought experiments.
