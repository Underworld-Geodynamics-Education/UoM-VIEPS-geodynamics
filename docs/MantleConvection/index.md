# Mantle Convection

In the lectures we discovered that the fiendishly complicated equations of motion / energy conservation for a convecting, viscous fluid lead to some strikingly simple behaviour. In fact, it turns out that the only free parameter is the _Rayleigh number_. This probably seems counter intuitive so the idea of the exercises today is to demonstrate that this is really the case.

We will also learn about how the convection problem is solved numerically and some of the tricks you might need to know in order to complete the take home exercise.
