    "## Mantle Convection Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This take home assessment exercise builds upon the in-class work we have done on _Rayleigh-BÃ©nard_ convection (convection in a layer of fluid heated from below and cooled from above).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how boundary layer **theory** can predict the thickness of the thermal boundary layer (and therefore the heat-transport efficiency), and average velocity from the Rayleigh number alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theory predicts that the relationships will have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{Nu} = a \\mathrm{Ra}^{\\alpha}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{rms} = b \\mathrm{Ra}^{\\beta}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`underworld`](http://www.underworldcode.org) models we developed in class can be used to determine the values of the constants $\\alpha, \\beta$ (and $a,b$ )numerically to see if they agree with the predictions of the theory. For example, here is a graph of some of the simulations I showed in the lectures which demonstrates how to get these values.\n",
