The assessment of this course is in two parts:

  1. Exercises to be completed each day of the course. These are short and intended to be completed as a class exercise but they do need to be submitted !

  2. Completion of specific exercises which build upon the course examples and which will be marked.   These exercises are due one week after the completion of the course unless (or as agreed)

The assessment exercises which we want you to complete for credit after the course are in the following Exercise notebooks:
