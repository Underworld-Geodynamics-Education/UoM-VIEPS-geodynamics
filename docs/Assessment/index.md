# Exercises

The assessment of this course is in two parts:

  1. Exercises to be completed each day of the course. These are short and intended to be completed as a class exercise but they do need to be submitted !

     See <a href="/notebooks/Assessment/InClassProblemSets"> In Class Notebooks </a>

  2. Completion of specific exercises which build upon the course examples and which will be marked.   These exercises are due one week after the completion of the course unless (or as agreed)

     See <a href="/notebooks/Assessment/TakeHomeProblemSets"> Take Home Notebooks </a>

     - Exploring the relationship between Nusselt Number and Rayleigh number and relate the results to
       the dynamic Earth. This exercise requires running the convection model from the course at different
       Rayleigh numbers and obtaining quantitative information. You will need to consider the computational aspects
       convection: how to ensure you have good resolution, how to obtain results in a reasonable amount of time, how
       to be sure that any time-dependence is accounted for correctly.

     - **Either:**

        Consider the extensional model case which we dealt with in class. Can you add sediment deposition to the extension model by converting the sticky air into slightly heavier material when it falls below a reference level ? Does this change the pattern of deformation ? Can you visualise the pattern of deposition as a function of time ? Can you reverse the sense of deformation and invert the basin ? Can you make an unconformity ? How is sediment loading important for the evolution of basins in the Earth ?

     - **Or:** Subduction zone model based assignment

       As instructed by Rebecca in the class with the following follow up notes:

       **Resolution test**

       * Produce a range differing grid resolution models.  
       * When do you know the model is numerically resolved ?  
       * What resolution have you chosen to proceed with? Why?  


       **Force balance of subduction**

       * Produce a range of models differing driving and resisting forces.
       * Quantify the subducting plates evolution. Discuss.
       * The overriding plate has not been included here. Can you quantify the deformation it would experience?
       * Discuss the evolution of the trench, the overriding plate and the subducting plate in the models produced above.
       * Discuss the resulting tectonic setting.


     For each of these exercises you will need to complete the computational part in a notebook and give a 1000 word summary of the results of this work which also includes (about half) a description of the application in the context of Earth dynamics.
