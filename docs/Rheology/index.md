# Rheology and Localisation

In this section of the course, we discuss how the non-linear feedback between deformation and strength leads to localisation and how this relates to plate tectonics and mantle convection.

Our numerical examples deal with "shear band" formation. This is a well known phenomenon that has been extensively studied but is still poorly understood at a very basic level. Shear bands are near-linear features which form when rocks at fairly low pressure or granular materials are sheared. Instead of deforming in a uniform fashion, the material organises itself so that small regions take up most of the deformation in very narrow bands while the rest of the material remains stagnant.

Sand box experiments usually interpret shear bands as being equivalent to faults in the crust. In a structural sense they do serve as a good analogy. The same "localisation" property is clearly at work in plate tectonics since the lithosphere organises itself to deform in narrow plate boundaries even if the forces come from large-scale convection cells with a relatively smooth velocity distribution.
