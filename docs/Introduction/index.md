# Introduction to Geodynamics

We will begin the course by thinking about the observations allow us to develop a quantitative understanding of large-scale geodynamics. Of particular interest is the relationship between convection in the deep Earth and the surface expression of this circulation in the form of plate tectonics.

We will discuss how we use geology, geodesy, seismology, model building (mathematical and computational), to understand how Earth works at this scale.

In order to explore how global geodynamics works, we will be using the computational modeling tool `underworld` which is one of the research codes written by (predominantly) the University of Melbourne and Monash University geodynamics groups.

## Introduction to Underworld

First of all we will work through some hands-on exercises to build up a general understanding of the way the underworld code works, how its concepts are expressed in python, and how to run the given examples.

Templates for this exercise are located in the <a href="/notebooks/Underworld/"> Underworld </a> folder.

As well as the notebook exercises we go through in class, the <a href="/notebooks/Underworld/user_guide"> Underworld </a> folder also contains all the documentation for the code which is also in the form of notebooks.
